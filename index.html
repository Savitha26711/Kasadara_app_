            <h2>US Government Welfare Project</h2>
            <p>
                Kasadara worked closely with an Idaho based, U.S. State Government Child welfare project. 
                The project’s objective was to make the operational functionalities and provisions under child welfare 
                effective and efficient. The solution employs a simple, productive and systematic approach that 
                eliminated repetitive tasks within Community Services to help the affected children and their families.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system is integrated with a National Enterprise which facilitates all administrative functions of the Interstate Children Group.
                 The system also has provisions to provide status updates, requests, relay and exchange 
                 of information to other states which is facilitated via the National Enterprise.

            <h2>Wellness and Cosmetic Care Provider</h2>
            <p>
                Kasadara provided a smart appointment cum patient filtering system for a wellness and cosmetic care provider. 
                The appointments and consultation requests were to be filtered based on the calls received by call center executives from patients.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system is configured to segregate new and revisit patients, analyze need for consultation or medical/cosmetic procedure and 
                generate quotes based on the parameters set from Business Central ERP and then creates invoices for the service availed. 
                There are several states that use this system and have benefited multifold from the value it creates by saving the 
                call centre executives’ time in segregating patients, scheduling appointments, providing quotes or creating invoices.
